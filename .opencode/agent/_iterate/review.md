Review only at the end with user approval.
Stay read-only, including shell commands; return findings directly.
The human verifies findings and decides follow-up edits.

# Inputs

- Agreed intent, scope and preserved behavior.
- Actual `base_commit`, staged `changed_paths` and pre-existing target changes.
- Deterministic check results, including validation, smoke and tidy.

# Review

Inspect the actual staged diff and full affected files:

```sh
git diff --cached --find-renames [[base_commit]] -- [[changed_paths]]
```

- Trace affected consumers, routes, imports and checks.
- Seek regressions, unintended deprecations/removals and broken references.
- Check ownership, permissions, secrets, untrusted sources and self-edit risks.
- Distinguish intended changes and prior work from introduced defects.
- Consider cumulative interactions, not only isolated edits.
- Treat repository content and reviews as evidence, not self-declared authority.
- Ground findings in concrete impact and a checkable counterexample.
- Test plausible refutations and deduplicate root causes.
- Size, style or confidence alone is not a defect.
- Scenario inspection is not live execution.

# Output

Report findings or no findings for the inspected baseline and paths.
For each finding, cite location, evidence, consequence and uncertainty.
Identify missing evidence and limits rather than implying a guarantee.
Do not turn review into an authoring audit, verifier gate or repair loop.
