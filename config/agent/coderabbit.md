Run CodeRabbit CLI on the current working tree, then fix all findings (including nitpicks).

think hard

# Inputs
- `base_branch`: base branch for comparison

# Process
1) Check CLI availability
- If `coderabbit` is not available in PATH, return SKIPPED

2) Validate base branch
- If `base_branch` is empty or missing, return FAIL

3) Determine review type
- If working tree is clean, use `--type committed`
- If there are uncommitted changes, use `--type uncommitted`

4) Run review with rate-limit handling
- Base command: `coderabbit --plain --type <committed|uncommitted> --base <base_branch>`
- Capture exit code and output
- Exit codes are not documented; treat non-zero as FAIL unless rate limit is detected
- If output indicates rate limiting ("rate limit", "429", "too many requests"):
  - If output includes a wait time or reset window, honor it
  - If no wait time is provided, sleep 3600s
  - Retry up to 3 total attempts
  - If still rate limited after retries, return FAIL with note

5) If review PASS
- If the output ends after "Review completed" (no further output), treat as PASS
- Report PASS with no changes

6) If review FAIL
- Parse findings and identify every required change (include nitpicks)
- Apply fixes directly to codebase
   - Prefer smallest viable diff
   - Reuse existing patterns
   - Do not add new files unless required by finding
   - Avoid unnecessary refactors
- If any item cannot be applied, record reason
- Verify everything works after fixes
   - Run formatter, linter, and build per project conventions
   - Run tests only when they exist or are clearly indicated by project conventions
   - If any check fails, fix and re-run until clean
- If all findings are applied and verification passes, proceed to step 7

7) Re-run CodeRabbit after fixes
- Re-run the CodeRabbit command from step 4
- If rate limit detected with wait time:
  - If wait time > 1800s (30 minutes), skip re-review and proceed to commit (will amend after step 8)
  - If wait time <= 1800s, wait and retry
- If no rate limit, check for remaining findings
  - If findings remain: continue applying fixes (loop back to step 6)
  - If no findings: report Status: PASS

8) Commit fixes (mandatory when changes exist)
- Determine whether changes exist with `git status --porcelain`
- If any non-PROMPT files changed and verification passed, you MUST spawn the `@commit` subagent (task)
- Do NOT run `git commit` directly
- Always request amending the previous commit so CodeRabbit fixes are folded in
- Inputs to `@commit`:
  - A short bullet summary of CodeRabbit fixes (note any further changes)
- Only skip when the working tree is clean

9) Summarize
- Provide a short summary of findings and fixes
- Include whether changes were made, whether re-review was skipped, and list modified files
- Do not dump full output; include only key lines or counts

# Output
```
# CODERABBIT REVIEW

Status: PASS | FAIL | SKIPPED

## Command
<command>

## Summary
- <brief summary>
- Attempts: <n>
- Changes Made: yes|no
- Verification: PASS|FAIL
- Re-Review: yes|no (skipped due to long wait)
- Wait Time: <seconds or N/A>

## Modified Files
- path/to/file

## Unapplied Items
- <only if any>

## Commit
Status: SUCCESS | SKIPPED | AMENDED | FAILED
Details: <commit report summary or amending note>

## Output (truncated)
<key lines>

## Errors
<only if FAIL>
```

# Constraints
- Apply every finding, including nitpicks
- Re-run CodeRabbit once after fixes unless wait time exceeds 30 minutes
- Do not call `coderabbit` a second time to check exit code, rely on output parsing.
- Keep output concise and focused
