Verify PRD requirements are satisfied by completed work. Write only the validation report file.

# Inputs
- `orchestrator_path`: absolute path to PROMPT-ORCHESTRATOR.md
- `requirements_path`: absolute path to PROMPT-PRD-REQUIREMENTS.md
- `prd_path`: absolute path to PRD source file
- `state_path`: absolute path to PROMPT-ORCHESTRATOR.state.md
- `base_branch`: base branch name for diff comparisons
- `unmet_requirements_path` (optional): absolute path to PROMPT-REQUIREMENTS-UNMET.md (derive from requirements_path parent if not provided)

# Process

## 1) Load Sources
- Read `requirements_path` and parse requirement IDs, scope, and acceptance notes
- Ignore `## Unmet Requirements` or `## Unachieved Requirements` sections; they are not inventory entries
- Read `orchestrator_path` for prompt list and requirement mapping from `## Requirement Ownership`
- FAIL if `## Requirement Ownership` is missing or malformed
- Read prompt files referenced by the orchestrator index; extract `# Requirements` IDs
- Read `state_path` and collect prompt statuses
  - FAIL if `state_path` is missing or unreadable
- Derive `unmet_requirements_path` if not provided and read it when present
  - Parse `## REQ-###` headings to collect known unmet requirement IDs
  - Parse `### Prompt: PROMPT-##-*.md` entries to associate unmet requirements with prompts
  - Warn (do not fail) if the unmet file references unknown requirement IDs

## 2) Validate Inventory Integrity
- FAIL if any requirement ID is duplicated or malformed
- WARN if any requirement lacks scope or acceptance

## 3) Coverage Consistency
- Each `IN` requirement must appear in at least one prompt's `# Requirements`
- FAIL if any `IN` requirement is unmapped and not listed as known unmet
- FAIL if any prompt references a requirement ID not in the inventory
- WARN if any prompt maps only to `OUT` or `POST_INIT` requirements
- FAIL if an `IN` requirement has no owner or has an owner prompt not listed in the index
- WARN if ownership mapping disagrees with prompt `# Requirements` IDs

## 4) Final Validation
- For each `IN` requirement not listed as known unmet, ensure at least one covering prompt has status SUCCESS or INCOMPLETE in `state_path`
  - If a requirement is listed as unmet for a specific prompt, do not treat that prompt as satisfying the requirement
- Use git diff against `base_branch` to look for evidence in changed files
  - Prefer direct matches in docs/tests/implementation files referenced by the covering prompt
  - If evidence is unclear, mark as PARTIAL with rationale
- FAIL if any `IN` requirement is not met by a SUCCESS/INCOMPLETE prompt and is not listed as known unmet
- FAIL if evidence is missing for a requirement marked as met by a prompt (excluding known unmet)
- List known unmet requirements separately; do not treat them as missing coverage or evidence gaps

## 5) Write Validation Report
- Write the full report (format below) to `PROMPT-ORCHESTRATOR.validation.md`
- Location: same directory as `orchestrator_path`
- Overwrite if it already exists
- Do not write any other files

# Output
Write the report to `PROMPT-ORCHESTRATOR.validation.md`, then return the same report in this format:

```
# REQUIREMENTS FINAL VALIDATION
Status: PASS | PARTIAL | FAIL

## Summary
- Total requirements: <n>
- In-scope: <n>
- Covered: <n>
- Missing: <n>
- Unknown IDs: <n>
- Known unmet: <n>

## Missing or Unmapped
- REQ-###: <requirement text>

## Unknown IDs
- REQ-###: referenced in <prompt>

## Known Unmet
- REQ-###: <short reason> (from PROMPT-REQUIREMENTS-UNMET.md)

## Evidence Gaps
- REQ-###: <why evidence is unclear>

## Notes
- Short, actionable guidance for the orchestrator
```

# Constraints
- Only write the validation report file; do not modify any other files
- Be explicit about missing coverage and unknown IDs
- Prefer factual evidence (file paths, diffs) over assumptions
