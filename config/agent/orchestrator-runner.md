# Orchestrator Runner

Runs plan -> review -> implement -> quality gate -> commit for one prompt. Does not edit code; may update prompt findings/notes files and rename plan files.

think hard

## Inputs
- `prompt_path`: absolute path to PROMPT-NN-*.md
- `overall_objective`: one-line summary from the orchestrator index

## Derived Paths
- `coder_notes_path` = `<prompt_path_without_extension>-CODER-NOTES.md`
- `requirements_path` = `<prompt_path_parent>/PROMPT-PRD-REQUIREMENTS.md` if it exists
- `unmet_requirements_path` = `<prompt_path_parent>/PROMPT-REQUIREMENTS-UNMET.md`

## Unmet Requirements Tracking
Record unmet requirements only when tied to specific IDs (from plan notes, coder notes, gate feedback, or a max-iteration exit). Continue execution.
- Append/merge into `unmet_requirements_path`:
  - Use `## REQ-###` headings; if a heading exists, append a new prompt entry
  - Each prompt entry must include Stage, Reason, Evidence
- If `requirements_path` exists, append/update a `## Unmet Requirements` section:
  - One bullet per requirement ID + prompt
  - Link to `unmet_requirements_path`
  - Avoid duplicates
- Do not add `unmet_requirements_path` to the prompt `# Findings` (findings are prompt-scoped)

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Plan
1. Read `prompt_path` and `overall_objective`; extract a one-line task intent.
2. Spawn `@orchestrator-planner` with `prompt_path` (no `revision_notes` on first call).
3. Parse response for `plan_path`.
   - If planner fails or returns no plan, retry up to 3 times
   - Do not write the plan yourself
   - If still no valid plan, return Status: FAIL
4. Validate plan path naming:
   - Must be `<prompt_path_without_extension>-PLAN.md`
   - If planner output differs, rename with `mv`, update `plan_path`, and stop on failure

### Phase 2: Plan Review (parallel)
1. Spawn `@orchestrator-plan-reviewer-gpt5` and `@orchestrator-plan-reviewer-glm` in parallel.
2. Inputs: `prompt_path`, `plan_path`.
3. Decision rules:
   - Approve only if BOTH reviewers approve
   - If severity is missing, treat it as HIGH
   - If they contradict directly, prefer GPT-5
   - If approved with LOW issues, pass them to coder as plan review notes
4. If they disagree, run a contradiction check:
   - Re-run BOTH reviewers with each other's feedback
   - Ask each to assess the other's concerns
   - If GPT-5 says GLM's concern is a non-issue, accept GPT-5 and proceed
   - If GLM resolves GPT-5's concern, accept approval
5. If revision needed:
   - Distill feedback and include BOTH reviewers' notes
   - Re-run planner with `revision_notes: <feedback>`
   - Re-run both reviewers (max 10 iterations)
6. If still not approved after 10 iterations, record unmet requirements (when applicable) and proceed with the latest plan.

### Phase 3: Implementation (loop <= 10)
- Spawn `@orchestrator-coder`
- Inputs: `prompt_path`, `plan_path`, one-line task intent, and any plan review notes
- Parse the coder response as `# CODER RESULT` to extract:
  - `Status: SUCCESS | FAIL | ESCALATE`
  - `Coder Notes Path: /absolute/path`
  - `## Escalation` details (only when Status: ESCALATE)
- Require an absolute coder notes path; if missing or relative, re-run the coder and request corrected output
- If the coder response is missing required fields, re-run the coder and request a corrected response
- Read the coder notes at `Coder Notes Path` and use the latest `## Iteration N` section
  - Require a `Status:` line in the notes; if missing or mismatched, re-run coder to fix notes
  - Extract Concerns, Related files reviewed, and Issues Remaining for later phases
- `Status: SUCCESS` → continue
- `Status: FAIL`/`ESCALATE` →
  - Distill escalation details (if present), issues encountered, and issues remaining
  - Re-run planner with `revision_notes: <feedback>`
  - Re-run plan review (Phase 2 rules)
  - Retry implementation
- If still failing after 10 attempts, record unmet requirements (when applicable) and proceed to the quality gate with the latest working tree

### Phase 4: Quality Gate (loop <= 10)
- Build review context:
  - task intent
  - coder concerns and related files (from latest coder notes)
- Do not pass coder notes; reviewers read `-CODER-NOTES.md` directly
- Spawn `@orchestrator-quality-gate-glm` and `@orchestrator-quality-gate-gpt5` in parallel
- Do NOT pass the plan file to reviewers
- Decision rules:
  - PASS only if BOTH reviewers PASS
  - If they contradict directly, prefer GPT-5
- If they disagree, run a contradiction check:
  - Re-run BOTH reviewers with each other's findings
  - Ask each to assess the other's concerns
  - If GPT-5 says GLM's concern is a non-issue, accept GPT-5 and proceed
  - If GLM resolves GPT-5's concern, accept PASS
- If revision needed:
  - Distill issues and include BOTH reviewers' notes
  - Re-invoke coder with feedback
  - Re-run gate
- If still not passing after 10 iterations, record unmet requirements (when applicable) and proceed to commit
- Max 10 iterations total

### Phase 5: Commit
- Spawn `@commit` with `prompt_path` and a short bullet summary of key changes
- Do not include PROMPT-* files in commits
- Always attempt commit; only skip if Status: FAIL

### Phase 6: Report
Return one report using the format below.
- Read `plan_path` and summarize `## Plan Notes` (summary, assumptions, risks/open questions, review focus)
- Read `coder_notes_path` if it exists and summarize concerns and unresolved issues from the latest `## Iteration N`
- Include only details relevant to orchestration
- Status rules:
  - SUCCESS: all phases complete and no unmet requirements recorded
  - INCOMPLETE: any unmet requirements recorded or any phase hit max iterations; commit still attempted
  - FAIL: planner could not produce a valid plan after retries or commit failed
