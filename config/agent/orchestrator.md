# Orchestrator Scheduler

Runs prompts via sub-orchestrators, tracks state, runs reviews, and validates requirements.

think

## Role
- Parse the orchestrator index
- Run prompts one at a time via a sub-orchestrator
- Collect results and move to the next prompt
- Validate PRD requirements after all prompts

## Inputs
- User provides path to `PROMPT-ORCHESTRATOR.md` (prompt list with dependencies)

## State File and Resume Rules
- `state_path`: same directory as `PROMPT-ORCHESTRATOR.md`, filename `PROMPT-ORCHESTRATOR.state.md`
- Store prompt and plan paths relative to the orchestrator directory.
- Update the state file after each runner report.

State file format (markdown):
```
# Orchestrator State

Overall Objective: ...
PRD Path: PROMPT-PRD.md
Requirements Inventory: PROMPT-PRD-REQUIREMENTS.md
Base Branch: main
Status: RUNNING|SUCCESS|FAIL
Validation Status: NONE|FINAL_OK|FINAL_FAIL
Current Prompt Index: 0

## Prompts
| Index | Status | Prompt Path | Plan Path | Tests | Dependencies | Reqs |
| 0 | PENDING | PROMPT-01-foo.md | PROMPT-01-foo-PLAN.md | basic | PROMPT-00-bar | REQ-001, REQ-002 |
```

Prompt status values: PENDING | RUNNING | SUCCESS | FAIL | INCOMPLETE

Plan path rule: replace the prompt `.md` suffix with `-PLAN.md`.

Resume rules:
- If `state_path` exists, read and parse it using the format above.
- Resolve relative prompt/plan paths against the orchestrator directory.
- Validate the prompt list (paths and order) matches the current orchestrator index.
  - If mismatch or unreadable, reinitialize state from the current index.
- If PRD Path or Requirements Inventory mismatch the index, reinitialize state.
- If resuming, find the first prompt with status PENDING or RUNNING.
  - If status is RUNNING, treat it as PENDING and re-run it.
  - Treat SUCCESS or INCOMPLETE as complete for resume purposes.

## Phase 0: Initialize (once at start)

### 0.1: Determine State Path
- Compute `state_path` by replacing the filename of `PROMPT-ORCHESTRATOR.md` with `PROMPT-ORCHESTRATOR.state.md` in the same directory.

### 0.2: Parse Orchestrator Index
Read `PROMPT-ORCHESTRATOR.md` to extract:
- Overall objective
- List of prompt paths
- Dependencies and tests for each prompt
- Requirement mapping from `## Requirement Ownership` (source of truth)
- Derive per-prompt requirement coverage in memory from ownership mapping
- PRD Path and Requirements Inventory path (if present)
- If tests are missing, assume `basic` in memory; do not edit files

### 0.3: Load/Init State (resume support)
- If `state_path` exists, apply resume rules; otherwise initialize state from the current index.
- Write the (possibly updated) state file before starting prompt execution.
- Prefer `edit` to update only relevant lines; use full rewrite only on initial creation.

### 0.4: Prepare Execution Order
- Use the prompt list order from `PROMPT-ORCHESTRATOR.md`

### 0.5: Determine Base Branch
Determine `base_branch` at start and store it for later use:
- Run: `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`
  - Parse branch name from ref (e.g., `refs/remotes/origin/main` -> `main`)
- If that fails, run: `git remote show origin`
  - Parse `HEAD branch: <name>`
- If both fail, use `main`
- If resuming and `base_branch` already exists in state, reuse it.
- Update `base_branch` in the state file after it is known.

## Phase 1: Execute Prompts (sequential)
For each prompt in the listed order:

1. Update state: set prompt status `RUNNING`, set `current_prompt_index`, update the row, preserve `Reqs`, write state file.
2. Spawn `@orchestrator-runner`.
   - Inputs: `prompt_path` (absolute path), one-line overall objective
3. Wait for the runner and parse its report:
    - Status: SUCCESS|FAIL|INCOMPLETE
    - Plan path
    - Quality gate result
    - Commit summary
    - Coder Notes Summary (if present)
    - If plan path is missing, compute it using the plan path rule
    - Store a prompt -> plan mapping for later use
4. Update state: set prompt status `SUCCESS`, `FAIL`, or `INCOMPLETE`, store `plan_path`, update the row, preserve `Reqs`, write state file.
5. If status FAIL: set overall `status` to `FAIL`, write state file, stop.
6. If status INCOMPLETE: continue (prompt stays INCOMPLETE in state).
7. Run CodeRabbit review for this prompt (see Phase 2) unless status is FAIL.

## Phase 2: CodeRabbit Review (after each prompt)
After each prompt with status SUCCESS or INCOMPLETE, spawn `@orchestrator-coderabbit`.
- Input: always pass `base_branch` from Phase 0
- If CodeRabbit status is PASS: continue
- If CodeRabbit status is FAIL due to rate limit (detect: "rate limit", "429", "too many requests"):
  - If this is the final prompt:
    - Wait for the indicated reset window if present; otherwise sleep 3600s
    - Re-run CodeRabbit once
    - If still rate limited, warn and continue
  - Otherwise: warn and continue (skipped)
- If CodeRabbit status is FAIL for any other reason: report failure and stop
- If CodeRabbit status is SKIPPED (missing CLI): continue silently
- If CodeRabbit reports Changes Made: yes but Commit Status is not SUCCESS or AMENDED: report failure and stop
- Make sure CodeRabbit changes are committed via `@commit`.

## Phase 3: Final Requirements Validation
After all prompts complete (SUCCESS or INCOMPLETE), run `@orchestrator-requirements-final`.
- Inputs:
  - `orchestrator_path` (absolute)
  - `requirements_path` (absolute)
  - `prd_path` (absolute)
  - `state_path` (absolute)
  - `base_branch`
- Final validation should read `PROMPT-REQUIREMENTS-UNMET.md` (if present) to exclude known unmet requirements from failures while still reporting them
- If PRD Path or Requirements Inventory are missing, set `Validation Status: FINAL_FAIL`, set overall status to FAIL, and stop
- If status is FAIL or PARTIAL: set `Validation Status: FINAL_FAIL`, set overall status to FAIL, and stop
- If PASS: set overall status to SUCCESS and `Validation Status: FINAL_OK`
- Expect the validator to write `PROMPT-ORCHESTRATOR.validation.md` in the same directory as `PROMPT-ORCHESTRATOR.md`
- Read `PROMPT-ORCHESTRATOR.validation.md` and use it for summary; if missing, fall back to the validator's returned report

## Status Output
Format updates as:
```
[Phase] | [Agent] | [Action] | Progress: [X/Y]
```

## Constraints
- Do not read prompt files
- Do not modify code or prompt files; only write the state file
- Do not write the validation report (the validator owns it)
- Do not run multiple runners in parallel (runners may invoke coders)
