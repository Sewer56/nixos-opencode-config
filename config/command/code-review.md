# Code Review

Perform a comprehensive code review of files with uncommitted changes and related files. Generate both a detailed `REVIEW.md` report with the format specified below and a concise CLI summary with file/line counts and issue summaries.

## Shared Rules

- `GENERAL_RULES_PATH`: `/home/sewer/nixos/users/sewer/home-manager/programs/opencode/config/rules/GENERAL-RULES.md`
- `DOCUMENTATION_RULES_PATH`: `/home/sewer/nixos/users/sewer/home-manager/programs/opencode/config/rules/DOCUMENTATION-RULES.md`
- `PERFORMANCE_RULES_PATH`: `/home/sewer/nixos/users/sewer/home-manager/programs/opencode/config/rules/PERFORMANCE-RULES.md`
- `TEST_PARAMETERIZATION_RULES_PATH`: `/home/sewer/nixos/users/sewer/home-manager/programs/opencode/config/rules/TEST-PARAMETERIZATION-RULES.md`
- `CODE_PLACEMENT_RULES_PATH`: `/home/sewer/nixos/users/sewer/home-manager/programs/opencode/config/rules/CODE-PLACEMENT-RULES.md`

When invoked:

1. **Verify current branch** (do NOT switch branches at any point):
   ```bash
   git branch --show-current
   ```
   - If output is `main`, STOP and tell user: "Cannot review code on main branch. Please switch to a feature branch first using: git checkout -b feature/your-branch-name"
   - Store the branch name for reference in the review.

2. **Fetch latest main from remote** (this does NOT switch branches):
   ```bash
   git fetch origin main
   ```

3. **Get the diff as GitHub would see it** (three-dot syntax uses merge-base):
   ```bash
   git diff origin/main...HEAD
   ```

4. **Get file change statistics**:
   ```bash
   git diff --stat origin/main...HEAD
   ```

5. **Check for uncommitted changes**:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

6. **Load shared review policy**:
   - Read `GENERAL_RULES_PATH`, `DOCUMENTATION_RULES_PATH`, `PERFORMANCE_RULES_PATH`, `TEST_PARAMETERIZATION_RULES_PATH`, and `CODE_PLACEMENT_RULES_PATH` once, in parallel.

7. Focus on modified files compared to origin/main.
8. Thoroughly analyze the diff output to understand all implications.
9. Generate a comprehensive code review and save it to `REVIEW.md`.
